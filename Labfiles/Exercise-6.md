# Exercise 6: Using GitHub Copilot for T-SQL and YAML code

In this exercise, the primary objective is to leverage the capabilities of GitHub Copilot, a powerful AI-assisted coding tool, to assist you in generating code for two distinct programming languages: T-SQL and YAML. You can leverage comments to generate Copilot suggestions!

>**Disclaimer**: GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest an entire function body or code in grayed text. Examples of what you'll most likely see in this exercise, but the exact suggestion may vary.

   ```

1. Press enter to go to a new line. Copilot will suggest a code block.
